# EntityScripter

EntityScripter is a Spigot plugin which lets you code your own mobs with a ridiculous amount of options (which I'm still adding, currently ironing out bugs first) using a .yml config per mob.

I decided to make this plugin because I wasn't satisfied at all with most of the custom mob plugins out there.

With this plugin, you can:

* add particles, potions, equipment of any kind
* set zombies to villager zombies
* set the age of ocelots
* set the mob to be hostile even if it's docile
* do things with the mob per tick
* do things according to various events that happen to the mob
* make the mob spawn naturally
* set the mob's drops, make the mob a pet
* randomize variables
* etc....

All still in progress, but I need help working on it. If you're interested in helping with development, go right ahead and submit some pull requests.
